# Pipeline/webserver

This directory holds the index page hosted by the Nginx Docker container as well as some example files that demonstrate the crude HTML files generated by the pipeline. Samples can be found in the `example_files` directory. The watchdog script launches the webserver in a detached mode with the following command after copying the `index.html` file to a new webserver directory:

```shell
docker run --name=webserver --rm -d \
--mount type=bind,source=${DIR_WATCH}/webserver,target=/usr/share/nginx/html,readonly \
--publish 8528:80 \
nginx:alpine
```
`--name` is gives the container a specific name and is required to run in detached mode, `--rm` deletes the container once it is stopped, `-d` runs the container in detached mode which means that it can operate independently in the background, `--mount` is specifying that a directory on the local machine will be bound to the HTML file directory of the container and is only available in read-only mode, `publish` is specifying the port that the webserver can be reached at, and `nginx:alpine` is specifying the image to use from Dockerhub.
